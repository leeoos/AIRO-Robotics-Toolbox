## Introduction
This repo is a collection of useful tools for the courses of Robotics 1 and Robotics 2 at DIAG (Sapinza). The `/scripts` folder contains matlab programs made to solve kinematics an dynamics problems in the contex of fixed based robots. A tipical application would be to use the tools to compute the dinamic model of a N joint spatial manipulator, given a basic parametrization of the robot (DH parameters).

## Requirements
Unfortunatly to try out this project it is required to have a updated version of [MATLB](https://it.mathworks.com/). MATLAB it it is not an open source free software so you need to pay fo it, this unless you have a free account provided by you organization. If you are a Sapienza student you can obtain MATLAB [here](https://web.uniroma1.it/infosapienza/portale-matlab-sapienza). 
To run the scripts smoothly it is also suggested to download MATLAB 2023b and to install the additional tools for robotics.
